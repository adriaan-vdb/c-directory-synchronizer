GENERAL PROJECT NOTES (Josh):
- Files are identical if they have the same file-name and contents, in the same relative location (relative to the top-level directory)
- -i and -o options only apply to files! (not directories)
- Default permissions are 0666 for files and 0777 for directories
- What happens when we sync a directory and its subdirectory (does the program only pass through once? or does it infinitely execute)


SUGGESTED SYSTEM CALLS (and what they do!):
- perror: prints an error message to stderr (error output stream)
- getopt: gets the flags placed in the command call
- malloc: allocates memory to a pointer
- realloc: resizes memory pointed to (by a pointer)
- strdup: duplicates a string

Queries:
1. When sub directories are empty - remember to sync?
